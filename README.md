## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This can be easily be run on kaggle kerels. It comes with all necessary libraires.. Although only baisc libraries are used and Python 3.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

As I saw the tianic movie, I was amazed by it and also I saw that on Kaggle the data was available of its survivors. Thus is decided to use that data. I asked the following questions -

Question 1: There were how many people which embarked from different ports? And whether is there a correlation between the survival and the port of the embankment?

Question 2: Does survival depend upon the Passenger Class?

Question 3: Do the passengers survival depends on their family size?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook here answers all the above questions with their corresponding codes.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@harshmalra/who-will-survive-the-titanic-d63974f28a77).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

And thanks to Kaggle for their dataset. This dataset, licensing and other information can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
